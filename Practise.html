<mark>SUB</mark>: <mark>My Journey and Interest in Becoming a Web Developer</mark>

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is<strong> Ruthvik Dasari</strong>, and I am writing this letter to share my learning journey and my interest in becoming a web developer.
I have always been curious about how websites work and how information is presented clearly on the internet. This curiosity motivated me to start learning website development step by step.

I am currently learning <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, which are the basic technologies used to build websites. Through regular practice,
I am learning how to create web pages, structure content, and design simple layouts. I enjoy this learning process because it allows me to be creative while also improving my technical skills.
Each new topic encourages me to explore more and improve my understanding.

My goal is to become a skilled web developer and build user-friendly and attractive websites. I believe that continuous learning, hard work, and discipline will help me achieve this goal. I am highly motivated to develop my skills further and grow professionally in the field of web development.

Thank you for taking the time to read my letter.

<kbd>Yours sincerely,</kbd>
**Dasari Ruthvik**
